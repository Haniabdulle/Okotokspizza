        <h1>Okotok Pizza!</h1>
<h3>We were founded in Calgary,Alberta in the year 2002 as a “Pizza by Slice” take out restaurant in Calgary Downtown area. </h3>

    <main>
        
    <p>As our name states our focus was to provide great tasting pizza made with quality ingredients from the day, we opened our doors. Within a year of we opened our first store, we got very famous for the quality and fresh pizza slices. Long lineups formed in our Downtown store and people started requesting us to start whole pizza for delivery and pickup.

        Obeying our customers demand we soon started pickup and delivery of Pizzas maintaining the same quality and unlimited toppings options which was another unique feature of GCP. We guarantee top quality and handpicked “Always Fresh” ingredients in all our Pizzas that we cook.
        
        Are pizzas are cooked with special recipes by professional chefs to provide quality food with crispiness. From the day we opened our first store to date, we are always listening to our customers and travelling with them in the journey of food extravaganza. Today we have multiple locations across Calgary and have now opened our first Edmonton store in March 2021 due to higher demand from Edmontonians, who have tried our restaurants in Calgary.</p>
